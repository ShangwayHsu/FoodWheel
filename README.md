# FoodWheel
#### This application logs and let's people review/rank their favorite places to eat
#### in a certain area, and also chooses a place to eat based on various criteria.

## General
This application allows users to enter in new food places that they try and enjoy. 
For each entry/location given, the user can tag the location/restaurant/area with 
different topics, such that these locations can be sorted later on. For each store, 
the user may also list items from said store, and organize these items in a sorted list. 
This sorted list, indicating peoples' different preferences for different stores and foods,
will then be matched against that of other users, so that the end food place chosen
will reflect the general group's greater interest. 
For example, if one user really wants to eat Chipotle but everybody else prefers
Yiassuos, which is the clear superior choice here, the program will therefore weight
Yiassuos as more, since it would bring greater net satisfaction to the group
